# SCRNAseq

This project was done in the context of the Bioinformatics course at EPFL. It consists in the analysis of scRNAseq data obtained from a heterogenous mix of mouse cells. The objective was to retrieve the tissue of origin of the cells using gene set enrichment analysis. The project was performed with R.
